# React Example

A React starter project using Babel and Webpack. Includes React Router and server-side rendering.

## NPM scripts

Compile `app.min.js` in debug/development mode:

```sh
$ npm run webpack:dev
```

Compile `app.js` in production mode:

```sh
$ npm run webpack:prod
```

Compile both modes:

```sh
$ npm run webpack
```

Rewrite server-side renders for routes to the public directory:

```sh
$ npm run render
```
